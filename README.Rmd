Train stations and train in India, data issues
================================================

# Introduction

For the CHAI project <http://www.chaiproject.org/> I wanted to look whether there were trains in our study area. Besides, I was curious about two data sources:

* The Open Government Data (OGD) Platform of India <https://data.gov.in/>

* Openstreetmap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>

I moreover saw this blog article <http://curiousanalytics.blogspot.com.es/2015/04/indian-railways-network-using-r.html> 

In this README I'll explain where I got the data I decided to use, and which problems I still have.

# Getting and preparing the timetable

I used a different source than curiousanalytics. I used this train timetable from the OGD Platform of India: <https://data.gov.in/catalog/indian-railways-train-time-table-0> I tried to download the data from the API using the `ogdindiar` package <https://github.com/steadyfish/ogdindiar> but I got an error message from the server so I downloaded the data by hand. I then prepared it using the code in [this R code](R_code/getting_train_timetable.R)

The data look like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
load("train_data/train_timetable.RData")
knitr::kable(head(timetable))
```

It has `r nrow(timetable)` rows.

Now, how to get geographical coordinates for each station?

# Getting the coordinates for all stations

## Google Maps info 

I first used the same approach as curiousanalyics: querying Google Maps via the `geocode` function of the `ggmap` package for getting coordinates for each station name. One can see the code used for this at the beginning of [this R code](R_code/getting_coordinates.R)

After doing this I only had geographical coordinates for about 40% of the train stations.

## Openstreetmap info

Then I decided to get all train stations nodes from Openstreetmap. I downloaded the osm.pbf file for India from <http://download.geofabrik.de/asia/india.html> I filtered only the "railway=station" from this file using osmosis. The script is [here](osm_data/osmosis_script.txt). The osm.pbf file is not there because it was too big.

I parsed the OSM XML file using [this code](osm_data/reading_osm_file.R). Here maybe I could have made better use of the xml2 package and also of the osmar package but somehow I found it faster to write this code.

The data look like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
load("osm_data/OSMdataIndiaStations.RData")
knitr::kable(head(dataIndiaStations))
```

It has `r nrow(dataIndiaStations)` rows. So many train stations!

I gave priority to info I got from Google Maps but for the remaining ones I looked for close matches for names in the OSM data. I defined closes matches as names whose difference measured by the `stringdist` function of the `stringdist` package was 0 or 1. It is a bad solution because clearly doing this I'm giving wrong coordinates to some stations. 

The whole code is [here](R_code/getting_coordinates.R)

The resulting data look like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
load("geo_data/geoInfo.RData")
knitr::kable(head(listNames))
```

It has `r nrow(listNames)` rows.

# Remaining issues

* How to get coordinates for all stations?

* In general, how to optimally deal with different spellings of Indian locations?

* How should I read OSM files in a more elegant way? 

# Cool stuff I've learnt

* Openstreetmap and the OGD platform of India are goldmines.

* Comparing strings of characters could help with the spelling of Indian locations but also generally in our questionnaire data for dealing with typing errors in the free text areas.

I've read many forums in order to understand e.g. Openstreetmap, so thank you to all the people that asked and answered questions on these forums! Here is a smiling cat for all of you nice people. :smile_cat:
